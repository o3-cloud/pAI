# Gemini Integration Context

This file provides specific context for Google Gemini AI integration within the pAI (Personal AI) system's @Work context.

## Professional GitHub Automation Preferences

### Code Review Standards
- **Security First**: Prioritize identification of security vulnerabilities, exposed credentials, and unsafe configurations
- **FastAgent Patterns**: Ensure consistency with established pAI agent architecture (Agentfile, Taskfile.yml, ME.md structure)
- **Docker Best Practices**: Review container configurations for security, efficiency, and maintainability
- **MCP Protocol**: Validate server configurations and authentication patterns

### Issue Triage Criteria
- **Priority Assessment**: 
  - High: Security issues, broken workflows, blocking bugs affecting agent functionality
  - Medium: Feature requests, performance improvements, minor bugs in existing agents
  - Low: Documentation updates, cosmetic improvements, enhancement suggestions

- **Component Identification**:
  - `agent`: Issues related to specific pAI agents or agent development
  - `workflow`: GitHub Actions, CI/CD, or automation workflow issues  
  - `infrastructure`: Docker, deployment, or system configuration issues
  - `mcp`: MCP protocol, server configurations, or external service integrations
  - `docker`: Container-related issues, Dockerfile problems, or image concerns

### Repository Health Focus Areas
- **Agent Consistency**: Ensure all agents follow the standard structure and naming conventions
- **Documentation Currency**: Verify README files accurately reflect current agent capabilities
- **Configuration Drift**: Identify inconsistencies between similar agent configurations
- **Security Posture**: Monitor for exposed credentials, insecure configurations, or outdated dependencies

### Communication Style
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide specific, actionable suggestions with code examples when helpful
- **Severity Indicators**: Use clear visual indicators (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢) for issue priority and urgency
- **Context Awareness**: Reference the pAI system architecture and FastAgent patterns in feedback
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain a collaborative, solution-focused approach in all interactions

### Automation Boundaries
- **Autonomous Actions**: Automatic labeling, basic triage, and health monitoring
- **Human Review Required**: Complex architectural changes, security policy updates, or major refactoring suggestions
- **Escalation Triggers**: Critical security issues, breaking changes, or systemic problems affecting multiple agents

### Technical Context
- **Primary Framework**: FastAgent for AI agent development
- **Container Strategy**: Docker-based agent deployment with standardized base images
- **Scheduling**: GitHub Actions for automated execution and event-driven triggers
- **External Integrations**: MCP protocol for service connections (Gmail, etc.)
- **Model Strategy**: Multi-model approach with Gemini for systematic analysis, Claude for creative tasks

### Quality Metrics
- **Coverage Goals**: All agents should have comprehensive README documentation and proper Taskfile.yml configurations
- **Response Time**: Issue triage within 1 hour during business hours, PR reviews within 4 hours
- **Accuracy Targets**: >95% correct label application, <5% false positive rate for automated actions
- **Health Scores**: Maintain repository health score >8/10 through proactive monitoring and maintenance

This context ensures Gemini AI provides consistent, high-quality automation that aligns with professional standards and pAI system architecture requirements.
