  "critiques": [
    "The system lacks concrete ROI measurements to justify the complexity and cost of maintaining multiple LLM-powered agents",
    "Heavy dependency on external APIs (OpenAI, Gmail) creates significant vendor lock-in and reliability concerns", 
    "The manual maintenance of ME.md context files represents a potential bottleneck that could lead to agent drift",
    "No clear governance model is provided for managing agent conflicts or coordinating between multiple agents",
    "Security model appears insufficient for handling sensitive corporate or personal data in agent prompts",
    "The learning curve for FastAgent, MCP protocol, and Taskfile may be too steep for non-technical users",
    "Agent effectiveness measurement is acknowledged as needing improvement but no concrete metrics are proposed",
    "The system architecture may become overly complex as the number of agents grows without proper abstraction layers",
    "Limited discussion of failure modes and recovery strategies when agents malfunction or produce incorrect outputs",
    "The current implementation status shows more planned/experimental agents than production-ready ones, questioning system maturity"
