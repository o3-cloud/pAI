## 🛠️ Technical Details

### GitHub Actions Integration
All agents are designed to run as GitHub Actions workflows, triggered by:
- **Pull Requests**: Code review assistance, security scanning
- **Scheduled Events**: Regular maintenance, reporting, cleanup
- **Manual Dispatch**: On-demand analysis and reports
- **Issue Comments**: Interactive agent responses

### MCP Server Integration
Agents can integrate with various MCP servers for:
- **Database Access**: Query analysis and optimization
- **Cloud APIs**: Infrastructure monitoring and management
- **Communication Tools**: Slack, Teams integration
- **Documentation**: Wiki and knowledge base updates

---

## 🔄 Interaction Model

- **Tone**: Professional, concise, actionable
- **Delivery**: GitHub comments, Slack notifications, email summaries
- **Autonomy**: Mostly informative and suggestive, with some autonomous actions for low-risk tasks
- **Trust Boundaries**:
  - Never make production changes without approval
  - Always provide context and reasoning
  - Escalate when uncertain

---

## ✨ Benefits

- Catch issues before they become problems
- Maintain consistent code quality standards
- Reduce time spent on routine analysis
- Improve team knowledge sharing
- Focus on strategic work over operational toil

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap / Next Steps

- [ ] Set up foundational `ME.md` for professional context
- [ ] Implement first DevOps agent (PR Diff Auditor)
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflows for scheduled agents
- [ ] Build Slack integration for notifications
- [ ] Expand based on team feedback and value delivered

## ⚠️ Challenges & Constraints

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| False positives | Tune thresholds based on historical data |
| Security exposure | Limit agent permissions, audit actions |
| Team disruption | Start with low-impact, informative agents |
| Maintenance overhead | Keep agents simple and well-documented |
