{
  "risks": [
    "High token costs from multiple LLM-powered agents running continuously could become prohibitively expensive",
    "Security vulnerabilities if sensitive data is inadvertently included in agent prompts or logs",
    "Agent coordination failures leading to duplicate work, conflicting actions, or missed tasks",
    "Context drift if ME.md files become outdated, leading to agents making incorrect decisions",
    "Over-reliance on external dependencies (OpenAI API, GitHub Actions) creating single points of failure",
    "Inadequate feedback loops making it difficult to measure ROI and agent effectiveness",
    "Complexity scaling issues as more agents are added without proper management frameworks",
    "Data privacy concerns with personal and work information processed by external LLM services",
    "Agent malfunction or unexpected behavior due to prompt engineering issues or API changes",
    "Vendor lock-in to specific LLM providers or cloud services limiting future flexibility"
