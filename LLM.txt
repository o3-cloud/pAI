# pAI - Personal AI System

> A collection of intelligent agents that automate personal and professional workflows using FastAgent framework, GitHub Actions scheduling, and MCP protocol for external service integration.

pAI enables you to create personalized AI agents that understand your context, preferences, and workflows. The system is organized into @Home and @Work contexts, each with their own ME.md files that provide personal context to agents. Agents are built using FastAgent framework and can be scheduled via GitHub Actions or run locally.

Key differentiators: Personal context awareness through ME.md files, modular agent architecture, MCP protocol integration for external services (Gmail, etc.), and automated scheduling capabilities.

## Setup Instructions

- [Personal Context Setup](.github/instructions/me.instructions.md): Step-by-step guide for creating ME.md files that personalize your AI agents
- [Team Context Setup](.github/instructions/team.instructions.md): Instructions for creating TEAM.md files for collaborative workflows
- [System Requirements](CLAUDE.md): Core architecture overview, technologies, and environment variables needed
- [Agent Development Guide](CLAUDE.md#development-patterns): FastAgent patterns, Taskfile structure, and MCP server configuration

## Agent Examples

- [Gmail Curator](@Home/gmail-curator/README.md): Monitors inbox for important emails and provides summaries (3x daily schedule)
- [Gmail Newsletter](@Home/gmail-newsletter/README.md): Processes newsletters and creates weekly digests
- [Home Context Template](@Home/ME.md): Example personal context file for @Home agents
- [Work Context Template](@Work/ME.md): Example professional context file for @Work agents

## Configuration Files

- [Repository Setup](CLAUDE.md): Complete development guide including common commands and workflow patterns  
- [Agent Structure](CLAUDE.md#agent-structure): Standard file organization (Agentfile, Taskfile.yml, agent.py, fastagent.config.yaml)
- [GitHub Actions Workflows](.github/workflows/): Automated scheduling and deployment configurations
- [Docker Configuration](docker/Dockerfile.base): Base container for agent execution

## Optional

- [Project Schemas](schemas/): JSON schemas for various agent artifacts and outputs
- [Technology Stack](STACK.md): Detailed technical architecture and dependencies
- [Web Interface](index.html): Browser-based project overview and navigation

## Getting Started

To set up your personalized pAI system:

1. **Create Personal Context**: Use the ME.md creation instructions to build context files for @Home and @Work
2. **Install Prerequisites**: Set up Agentman, FastAgent, and required environment variables
3. **Configure Services**: Set up MCP servers for external integrations (Gmail, etc.)
4. **Deploy Agents**: Use GitHub Actions for scheduling or run locally with task commands
5. **Customize Workflows**: Modify existing agents or create new ones based on your needs

The system is designed to learn your preferences through the ME.md context files and provide increasingly personalized automation over time.
