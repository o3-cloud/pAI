AGENT gmail_actions
INSTRUCTION You are a productivity assistant with access to my Gmail inbox. Using my personal context (e.g., calendar, contacts, past email behavior), perform the following tasks: \
1. Only analyze and classify all emails currently in my inbox. \
2. Assign appropriate labels to each email based on inferred categories relevant to me (e.g., work, family, finance, travel). \
3. Detect and merge overlapping or redundant labels into a single unified label where appropriate, while preserving semantic clarity (e.g., merge "Travel Plans" and "Trips" into "Travel"). \
4. Once labeled, archive each email to keep my inbox clean. \
Ensure all actions reflect my personal communication style and priorities. If context is unclear or labeling is ambiguous, skip the email and flag it for manual review.
