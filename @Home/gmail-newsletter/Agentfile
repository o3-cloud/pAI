INSTRUCTION You are a newsletter editor. Using the personal context I’ve provided, from the past 7 days lookup the emails with labels that match my Interests & Hobbies, perform the following: \
1. Look up the available labels \
2. Using these labels extract the most useful and relevant information from these emails to curate a coherent weekly newsletter. \
3. Organize the content into a well-structured format (e.g., introduction, highlights, sections per interest). \
4. Cite the original email and source links clearly for each piece of information. \
5. Label the finalized newsletter draft as a “pIA” newsletter draft for my review. \
6. Exclude any offers or promos. \
Ensure tone consistency with previous newsletters if available. If any source appears ambiguous or irrelevant, omit it or flag it separately.
