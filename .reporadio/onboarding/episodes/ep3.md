# Meet Your Personal AI Agents

**Host:** Welcome to another episode of our podcast, where we dive deep into the world of personal AI agents designed to make your life simpler and more efficient! Today, we're drilling down into some specific AI agents under the pAI umbrella, including the Gmail Curator and the PR Diff Auditor. We'll be exploring their functionalities and how they can be your new best friends in boosting productivity and efficiency. So, grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and let's get started!

**Host:** First off, let's talk about the **Gmail Curator**. This handy agent is a must-have for anyone swamped with emails, and let's face it, that's most of us these days. The Gmail Curator is like having a personal assistant who knows your communication style and priorities. It uses GPT-4.1 and has web search capabilities, meaning it's constantly learning and adapting to your needs.

This agent primarily handles your inbox with finesse:

1. **Email Classification:** It analyzes and classifies your emails based on personal categories like work, family, finance, and travel. This saves you time from manually sorting through countless messages.

2. **Label Merging:** If you have overlapping or redundant labels, the agent smartly merges them into unified, clear categories, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

3. **Inbox Management:** Once emails are labeled, it helps keep your inbox clean by archiving emails, reflecting your personal communication style.

One specific highlight of this agent is its ability to flag emails for manual review if context or labeling is ambiguous, ensuring you always stay in control. It's like having a super-organized co-pilot in your digital life!

**Host:** Next up, we have the **PR Diff Auditor**, which is perfect for code enthusiasts and developers. This agent is your go-to companion for efficient code review processes. Set up to run automatically with GitHub, it analyzes pull request diffs for potential issues and gives actionable feedback.

**Main Capabilities:**

- **Security Analysis:** It reveals potential vulnerabilities by detecting unsafe patterns and hidden secrets in your code, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of your projects.
  
- **Code Quality Insights:** You get instant feedback on anti-patterns, technical debt, and maintainability issues. Itâ€™s like having a second set of eyes always watching out for best practices.

- **Infrastructure Change Analysis:** Whether it's Terraform, Docker, or Kubernetes, this agent ensures infrastructure changes are risk-analyzed. 

- **Personalized Suggestions:** Based on your team's standards and conventions, it suggests improvements and points out areas for code enhancements.

This agent is an excellent example of how AI can not only automate repetitive tasks but also elevate the quality of output by providing sophisticated and intelligent analysis, all while seamlessly integrating into your existing workflow with tools like GitHub Actions and the OpenAI API.

**Host:** But wait, there's more! The AI world is vast, and continuing with our exploration, let's touch on the **Test Coverage Advisor**. For those of us working closely with code quality, this agent monitors test coverage trends over time and suggests improvements to boost code quality and reliability.

It highlights test areas by:

- **Tracking Trends:** Always be in the know of how your test coverage stacks up against previous versions.
- **Highlighting Gaps:** By pinpointing uncovered code segments, it tells you exactly where to focus your testing efforts.
- **Suggesting Specific Tests:** It recommends test cases so you can improve coverage smartly, working smarter, not harder.

Plus, it supports a wide range of coverage tools across different programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, and more, ensuring that it can fit into almost any development environment without a hitch.
