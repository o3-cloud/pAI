    "monitor_name": "Eden Staging 5xx Rate is Elevated",
    "condition": "min(last_5m):sum:eden.requests{http_range:5xx,service:eden,env:staging}.as_count() / sum:eden.requests{service:eden,env:staging}.as_count() > 0.04",

  "analysis": {
    "flap_reason": "The alert uses min(last_5m) aggregation, making it sensitive to short-lived spikes. Rapid trigger and recovery indicate flapping.",
    "impact": "Frequent, non-actionable alerts may cause alert fatigue and reduce trust in monitoring."
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Switch aggregation from min(last_5m) to avg(last_5m) or increase window size.",
    "Enable require_full_window: true.",
    "Reevaluate if a 4% threshold is appropriate for staging.",
    "Use muting schedules during known noisy periods.",
    "Group by tags to isolate spikes to specific deployments or instances."
  ],
  "next_actions": [
    "Review current Datadog monitor configuration.",
    "Test updated threshold and window settings.",
    "Solicit feedback from engineering on alert actionability."

  "feedback_mechanism": "Slack thread replies and emoji reactions feed improvement loop."
