# pAI Specs Research Artifacts

This directory contains comprehensive research into the pAI specs system, including practical demonstrations of all 14 extractors.

## Structure

- `RESEARCH_REPORT.md` - Complete analysis and findings
- `*.json` - Extractor output examples for each of the 14 extractor types

## Extractor Demonstrations

### Simple Extractors
- `summary.json` - Content summarization from README
- `action-items.json` - Task identification and planning items  
- `tags.json` - Categorical classification
- `risks.json` - Risk identification and assessment

### Medium Complexity Extractors  
- `pros-cons.json` - Decision analysis framework
- `reasoning.json` - Justification and rationale capture
- `improvements.json` - Enhancement recommendations
- `followup-questions.json` - Investigation planning
- `missing-info.json` - Gap and requirement identification

### Complex Extractors
- `plan.json` - Step-by-step implementation roadmap
- `critique.json` - Critical evaluation and assessment
- `instructions.json` - Procedure extraction with confidence ratings
- `ideation.json` - Creative brainstorming and concept generation
- `reframe.json` - Perspective transformation (enterprise security view)

## Usage

Each JSON file demonstrates the structured output format for its respective extractor when applied to pAI repository content. These serve as:

1. **Templates** for future extractor applications
2. **Validation Examples** for JSON schema compliance  
3. **Integration Guides** for FastAgent framework adoption
4. **Quality Benchmarks** for extractor performance evaluation

## Key Insights

- All 14 extractors successfully process real-world content
- Structured outputs enable automated downstream processing
- Complex extractors (reframe, ideation, instructions) show sophisticated analytical capabilities
- System is ready for integration with existing pAI agent ecosystem

## Next Steps

Based on this research, the recommended implementation path is:

1. Create FastAgent integration library
2. Implement automated extractor application
3. Add validation and confidence scoring
4. Deploy in production agents for enhanced structured output
