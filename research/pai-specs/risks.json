  "risks": [
    "Token cost escalation as more agents are deployed and usage increases",
    "Security vulnerabilities from exposing sensitive data in agent prompts and configurations",
    "Agent coordination failures leading to duplicate processing or missed tasks",
    "Context drift as ME.md files become outdated or misaligned with current workflows",
    "Dependency on external APIs (OpenAI, Gmail) creating single points of failure",
    "Over-automation leading to reduced human oversight and control",
    "Agent hallucinations or errors causing incorrect automated actions",
    "Difficulty debugging complex multi-agent workflows",
    "Potential for agents to amplify biases or make poor decisions at scale",
    "Maintenance burden increasing as agent library grows without proper governance"
